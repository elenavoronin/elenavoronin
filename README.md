## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lena, and I'm working towards my goal of becoming a Software Engineer. I'm a student at Codam, a coding school in Amsterdam, where the focus is to teach you how to learn and prepare you for the real life in tech.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning c++ as part of the Codam Core Curriculum and studying python as a side project.
- ðŸ”­ I would rate my C skills as Advanced and my C++ profecient.

Currently my git portfolio is comprised mostly of Codam projects. You can browse around and see what I've been up to in the past 2 years.
